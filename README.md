# jedi-time

![](jedi.png)

A tiny Clojure library designed to _complement_ the `java.time` API (introduced with Java 8).
It exposes a handful of functions, and is mainly based on the `p/Datafiable` and `p/Navigable` protocols 
(introduced with Clojure 1.10).

## Premise 
`java.time` is a piece of art. The API is well thought out, its classes are immutable, its methods well named, 
the conventions/idioms introduced are sound and are consistently followed, and generally speaking it is (for the most part)
 a joy to work with.

## Aspirations
 
 Given the above premise, `jedi-time` **doesn't** try to be a full wrapper around `java.time`. There are good Clojure wrappers around.
 Instead, the intention here to provide a bridge from `java.time` objects to Clojure maps (and back - even if 
 the metadata was somehow lost). Navigation facilities (as you'll see below) do have a wrapper feel to them, but they don't even scratch the surface of the entire `java.time` API.  

## Convention
Temporal fields are hierarchical, and so in Java the naming convention follows the `bar-of-foo` pattern (e.g Chrono/ISO fields etc).
In `jedi-time`, `bar-of-foo` becomes path `[:foo :bar]`. For instance `ChronoField/DAY_OF_YEAR` becomes `[:year :day]`, 
and you can use it to pull out the value from the datafied  using `get-in` (see below). 

## Usage

### jedi-time.core

The majority of the functionality is provided in the core namespace. 
Loading/requiring it automatically extends `clojure.core.protocols/Datafiable` to the following 9 `java.time` types:

1. Month
2. DayOfWeek 
3. YearMonth
4. LocalTime
5. LocalDate
6. LocalDateTime
7. OffsetDateTime
8. ZonedDateTime
9. Instant

All datafied implementations return a `clojure.core.protocols/Navigable` map. 
You can think of it as a plain Clojure map if you only care about the raw data. 
However, navigation can take us places, so if you like travelling buckle on. ;) 

Ok, so you have a `java.time` object - what can you do with it? The obvious thing is to turn it into data 
(see the [intro](doc/intro.md) for an exhaustive list).

```clj
(require '[jedi-time.core :as jdt]
         '[clojure.datafy :as d])   ;; first things first

(d/datafy (jdt/now! :as :zoned-datetime)) ;; datafy an instance of ZonedDateTime
=> 
{:day  {:hour 20},               ;; hour of day
 :hour {:minute 9},              ;; minute of hour
 :week {:day {:name "WEDNESDAY", ;; name of day of week
              :value 3}},        ;; index of day of week
 :second {:nano 11914000,        ;; nano of second
          :milli 11,             ;; milli of second 
          :micro 11914},         ;; micro of second 
 :minute {:second 34}            ;; second of minute 
 :offset {:id "Z",               ;; id of offset  
          :hours 0,              ;; hours of offset
          :seconds 0},           ;; seconds of offset 
 :zone {:id "Europe/London"},    ;; id of zone
 :year {:month {:name "JANUARY", ;; name of month of year
                :value 1,        ;; index of month of year 
                :length 31,      ;; length of month of year (accounting for leap years)
                :day 8},         ;; day of month of year
       :length 366,              ;; length of year
       :leap? true,              ;; is leap year?
       :value 2020,              ;; value of year
       :day 8                    ;; day of year 
       :week 2}                  ;; week of year 
 }           

(class *1)
=> clojure.lang.PersistentArrayMap
```
This is the object represented as data. 
This alone, opens up a world of opportunities, but wait there is more...

Given the above data representation, we can navigate to a bunch of things 
(see the [intro](doc/intro.md) for an exhaustive list):

```clj
(let [datafied (d/datafy (jdt/now! :as :zoned-datetime))] 
  
  (d/nav datafied :format :iso)       =>  "2020-01-29T08:37:31.737789Z[Europe/London]"
  (d/nav datafied :format "yy-MM-dd") =>  "20-01-29"
  (d/nav datafied :to :instant)       =>  #object[java.time.Instant 0x19ca0015 "2020-01-29T08:37:31.737789Z"]
)
```
You can navigate to some (chronologically) modified, or alternate version (where supported).

```clj
(d/nav datafied :+ [3 :hours])
(d/nav datafied :- [2 :days]) ;; will correctly use Period (as opposed to Duration)

;;this may promote the types
(d/nav datafied :at-zone   ["Europe/London" :same-instant])
(d/nav datafied :at-offset ["+01:00"        :same-local])  
```

You can navigate to any direct parents (e.g. :local-time + :local-date => local-datetime) 
of the datafied object, except from a datafied `Instant` which can be navigated to pretty much anything: 

```clj

(let [datafied (d/datafy (jdt/now! :as :offset-datetime))] 
  (-> datafied  
     (d/nav :to :local-datetime) ;; => #object[java.time.LocalDateTime 0x7363452f "2020-01-29T10:15:21.399461"]
     d/datafy
     (d/nav :to :local-date)     ;; => #object[java.time.LocalDate 0x167f1c41 "2020-01-29"]
     d/datafy 
     (d/nav :to :year-month)     ;; => #object[java.time.YearMonth 0x9a9de2f "2020-01"]
    )
)

```

If calling `d/nav` returns a Java object, it is going to be one of the aforementioned 9 objects, and so it can be datafied. 
This whole datafy/nav dance basically creates a graph structure.   


#### jedi-time.core/undatafy 

As the name implies, `jdt/undatafy` is the opposite of `d/datafy`.
It can take any Clojure map (not necessarily the direct result of `d/datafy`), 
and turn it into the correct `java.time` object. Therefore, you don't need to worry about losing 
the metadata carried by the result of `d/datafy` (which conveniently includes the original object).

#### jedi-time.core/redatafy 

The composition of `jdt/undatafy` and `d/datafy`. Useful for re-obtaining `d/nav` capabilities on a meta-less mirror of something datafied.  


### jedi-time.parse
This is a convenience namespace. It provides the following (fully) type-hinted parsing functions, 
each taking one (String) or two (String, DateTimeFormatter) args.

- parse-zoned-datetime
- parse-offset-datetime
- parse-local-datetime
- parse-local-date
- parse-local-time
- parse-year-month

## TL;DR 

- `clojure.core/Datafiable` has been extended to the main 9 types in `java.time`.

- `(d/datafy x)` turns those 9 types into Clojure maps, and `jdt/undatafy` turns those (or meta-less mirrors of them) back into the right Java object.

- These maps can be navigated (via `d/nav`) in ways that reflect the semantics of the underlying Java objects (e.g formatting, comparing, shifting etc).  

- Some parsing helpers exist in `jedi-time.parse`.
